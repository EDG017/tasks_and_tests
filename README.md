# tasks_and_tests
Project for Software Engineering 2 course. My task was writting a lite version of lite timestamp converter changing a timestamp, given in seconds, to datetime in MM-DD-YYY.
This prjoect was created in a team of three as our final project for the CS 362 course at Oregon State University.
The project gave out three tasks, each member took one task and wrote the code for it.
Once the tasks had been written, each member then wrote unit tests to test the functionality of what they wrote.
